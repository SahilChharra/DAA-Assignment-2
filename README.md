# DAA-Assignment-2

### Name:- Sahil.R.Chharra
### Roll no :- A-61
### Subject :- Design and Analysis of Alogorithms
### Problem Statement :- Given an application and its implementation to demonstrate the implementation of XNOR gate [Digital Ckts]

### Logic/Thoery:-

Implementation of Artificial Neural Network for XNOR Logic Gate with 2-bit Binary Input
We implemente the logic of XNOR Logic gate to check for the snapses of brain cells. It's with the forward propagation function, the output is predicted. Then through backpropagation, the weight and bias to the nodes are updated to minimizing the error in prediction to attain the convergence of cost function in determining the final output.  

### Steps/Approach :- 
##### Step1: Import the required Python libraries 
##### Step2: Define Activation Function : Sigmoid Function 
##### Step3: Initialize neural network parameters (weights, bias) and define model hyperparameters (number of iterations, learning rate) 
##### Step4: Forward Propagation 
##### Step5: Backward Propagation 
##### Step6: Update weight and bias parameters 
##### Step7: Train the learning model 
##### Step8: Plot Loss value vs Epoch 
##### Step9: Test the model performance 

### Code :-
